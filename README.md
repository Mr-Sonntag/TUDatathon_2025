This project is being developed in collaboration with the contributors above for Temple University's Data Science Community's Datathon competition.

This project will utilize AI to consume user inputted video footage of basketball free throws in order to return some sort of analysis on the freethrow by using previously consumed data of pro basketball players shooting a freethrow.
